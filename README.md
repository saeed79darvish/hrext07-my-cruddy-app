Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS



      In this project I used bootstrap and fontawesome to give a good style to my application
      I made a div that is a container for whole body and I put a form tag in the container
      to get input of users and we have two input title and item, below the form I add a button to
      Add item to the list and finally I made a table to sort data an display our data in the Table

      after that I define a app.js file and in this file I used define three classes
      Lists to represents a list
      UI  to Handle UI tasks
      Store Handle storage with localStorage
